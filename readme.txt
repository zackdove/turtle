For my extra this week, I chose to recreate one of the first programs I ever
used on a computer: turtle.

I'm sure you will be familiar with how it works, and I'll list some instructions
below.

Run with ./turtle t to test

Commands:
FD x  = move forward by x units
RT x  = rotate clockwise by x degrees
LT x  = rotate anticlockwise by x degrees
COL x = change the colour to x where x is a decimal rgba representation
HM    = move to the origin
PEN   = toggles the pen up or down
CL    = clears the screem
END   = terminates

Commands can be input one a time, or several in a row
